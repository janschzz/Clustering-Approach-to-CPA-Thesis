\author{Your Full Name}
\maketitle

\section*{Repository Overview}
This repository contains the source code and supplementary materials related to my thesis, titled ``A Clustering Approach to Column Type Annotation: Effects of Pre-Clustering.'' The repository consists of three key files detailed below.

\subsection*{1. SemJET (Jupyter Notebook)}
This Jupyter Notebook contains the baseline algorithm and the SemJET algorithm. The following steps will guide you to execute the algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Running the Algorithms:} To execute either the baseline or SemJET algorithm, run all the cells from the beginning up to and including the cell marked with \texttt{\# Execute here}. Execution of this cell will start the chosen algorithm.
    \item \textbf{Dependencies:} Please note that the execution may require specific Python packages. If you encounter any missing dependencies, kindly install them using your preferred package manager (e.g., pip, conda).
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{2. (Irrelevant File)}
This file is not relevant to the thesis project and can be ignored.

\subsection*{3. Interval}
This file contains the simulation and all other results regarding the Interval aspect of the thesis. Detailed findings and methodologies are explored within the file, providing insights into the clustering process and its effects on the Column Type Annotation.
