# A Clustering Approach to Column Type Annotation: Effects of Pre-Clustering

This repository contains the source code and supplementary materials related to my thesis, titled "A Clustering Approach to Column Type Annotation: Effects of Pre-Clustering." The repository consists of two key files detailed below.

## Files Overview

### 1. SemJET (Jupyter Notebook)
This folder contains two Jupyter Notebook for the baseline algorithm and the SemJET algorithm. The following steps will guide you to execute the algorithms:

- **Running the Algorithms:** To execute either the baseline or SemJET algorithm, run all the cells from the beginning up to and including the cell marked with `# Execute here`. Execution of this cell will start the chosen algorithm.
- **Dependencies:** Please note that the execution may require specific Python packages. If you encounter any missing dependencies, kindly install them using your preferred package manager (e.g., pip, conda).

### 2. Interval
This file contains the simulation and all other results regarding the derived Interval aspect of the thesis. Detailed findings and methodologies are explored within the file.

## Installation and Setup
